# CSharp-Battleship-ConsoleApp
Just a basic windows  console terminal version of the classic game Battleship.

The game is set up for two players.  During the initial setup of the game each player gets the opportunity to set up ships on the board while the other looks away.  After the initial set up there is a coin toss to see who goes first. 

When game begins a grid will be displayed as a table with columns A-J and rows 1-10.  Each player takes turns entering coordinates based off of the grid and hits and misses will be displayed on each of the player's boards as a yellow 'M' character or a red "H" character.  This continues of course until the game ends (one player's ships are all sank).  At that point an option is given to end the game or start another round.

In order to run the game just download, compile, find another player, and enjoy.
